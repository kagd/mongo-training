# MongoDB Training

This repo was created while I was preparing to take the MongoDB certification exam.

This was created based on Mongo v7 and v8 was released while creating this repo. Syntax may have changed depending on when you are reading this.

## VS Code extension

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mongodb.mongodb-vscode)

You can use this extension to connect to your MongoDB instance and run queries from within VS Code.

**Note**: This extension will only run those files which end in .mongodb.js.
